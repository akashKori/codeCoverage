This file acts as a bundler for all variables/mixins/themes, so they
can easily be swapped out without `core.scss` ever having to know.

For example:

@import './variables/colors';
@import './variables/components';
@import './themes/default';
*/
@import './variables/colors';
@import './buttons';
@import './mixin';

/// font family which we are using in this project.
///@type font
$base-font-stack:   Roboto,sans-serif;


/// font family which we are using in this project.
///@type font
$base-font-size:14px;

///variable for float of divs
///@type position
$float-right:right;

///variable for float of divs
///@type position
$float-left:left;

///variable for full height of divs
///@type number
$height100:100%;
